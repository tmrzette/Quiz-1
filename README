# HTML & CSS

0. create an index.html and the first two sections of:

# JS

1. take this array and use one of the array methods (map...) to return a new array where 
each value is pluralized (you CANNOT look up a pluralize function online).

`const arr = ['dog', 'cat', 'puppy', 'cockroach'];`

2. create a constructor function (it can either be a psuedo-class or an es6 class) that 
models a die that has a value property and contains a roll method, which console logs the
 new value to the console

3. take this object and create a function that adds new friends to the friends array 
(it must be able to add one or multiple friends),but it cannot mutate the object, 
it must return a new object with the modified array (hint: object spread might help)

# DOM

4. Create a button and a `ul` in your HTML. In JavaScript, create an array containing the 
names of your friends (at least 10. If you don't have that many, include your imaginary ones). 
When the button is clicked, add each friend's name as an `li` to the `ul` on the page.

5. Make a function that loops through the spans that are on the page (the spans generated 
from step 6) and change all their text to be words from a sentence that you declare as a 
global variable. E.g. (var sentence = 'hello world my name is john doe, goodbye forever').

`const obj = {
    name: 'yaz',
    email: 'yaz@yaz.com',
    friends: [
        {
            name: 'jahan',
            email: 'jahan@jahan.com'
        },
        {
            name: 'rihanna',
            email: 'rihanna@rihanna.com'
        }
    ]
};`
